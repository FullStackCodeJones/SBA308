Project Title: Learner Data Processing Tool

Description: Welcome to my Learner Data Processing Tool! This project is all about making sense of learner submissions for the "JavaScript for Dummies" (Unitelligent to be politically correct) course. 
JavaScript for sure brought out the "break it down to me like I am five years old" in me.
By using JavaScript, we can analyze scores, validate assignments, and calculate averages, all while having a little fun!

Features:

Validate assignment groups against course information.
Process submissions and calculate scores based on assignment weight.
Handle late submissions with a deduction.
Display results in a clear and friendly format.
How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your favorite code editor (like VS Code).
Run the script to see learner data processed in the console.
Feel free to modify the sample data to test with different submissions!
Future Enhancements:

Add a little user interface for easier interaction.
Expand to include more detailed statistics and insights.
Acknowledgements: A big shoutout to my learning journey, my study team, and of course YOU Christina. I am growing slowly but surely in m y knowledge of JavaScript! #ABL
